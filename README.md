# pfQuest-vanillaplus
## What's going on here?
This is a quick and dirty way of modifying values of the pfQuest addon so it works with [Vanilla+](https://www.vanillaplus.org/). It requires the official [pfQuest](https://github.com/shagu/pfQuest/) to work. Hopefully it won't break with updates to Shagu's repository, but I guess only time will tell. This was initally created to correct the quest markers to the new location of Yojamba Isle, but there might be attempts at implementing the custom quests of V+ in the future.

All honor goes to [Shagu](http://shagu.org/) for their amazing contributions to wow addons.
